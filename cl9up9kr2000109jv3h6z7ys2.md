# how to use inertia-react with useForm

The problem I'm having is: after resetting the form with useForm's reset(), the data still doesn't change!

```
import {  useForm } from "@inertiajs/inertia-react";

const defaultFilterData: Filters = {
    search: '',
    trashed: '',
    role: ''
  }

const {data, getï¼ŒsetData, reset} = useForm(defaultFilterData)

``` 
In the above code, use setData in the form to update the value of the corresponding field, and then want to reset the form to the initial state, use reset, in

```
const handleReset = e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // reset() is not here, in button onClick function
    query();
  };

``` 

```
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit} onReset={handleReset}>
 ......
 </form>
``` 

It appears that the form value has not been changed, and it is effective to click the reset button twice. At first I thought it was the option preserveState: true in the get method: it was caused by removing the preserveState, but the data of the form value was all gone after the submit button was clicked.

```
 const query = pickBy(data);
    get(Routes.users(Object.keys(query).length ? query : { remember: "forget" }), {
      preserveState: true,
      preserveScroll: true,
      replace: true,
      only: ["users"],
    });
  };
``` 
So I continued to investigate, thinking about what went wrong. After trying, I found that putting reset() on the onClick of the reset button solved it:

```
 <Button type="submit" colorScheme="facebook" width="full" disabled={processing}>
              inquire
 </Button>
  <Button type="reset" colorScheme="gray" width="full" onClick={() => { reset() }}>
              reset
  </Button>
``` 
Why is this? It is a problem of the rendering time process of the function component render of react, and the problem of using hooks!
